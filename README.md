## 📧 Email Spam Classifier App
The Email Spam Classifier App is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that predicts whether an email or SMS message is spam or not.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for spam detection. It demonstrates a complete ML workflow:
  - Data preprocessing & cleaning
  - TF-IDF feature extraction
  - Model training & comparison (Naive Bayes vs Logistic Regression)
  - Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve)
  - Interactive predictions with probability visualization
  - Downloadable trained models and vectorizer for reuse

This project is perfect for showcasing machine learning, NLP, and full-stack data science skills to recruiters.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Spam messages cause fraud, privacy breaches, and poor user experience.
This project aims to automatically detect spam messages using supervised
machine learning.

---

## 🔥 Features
- Interactive Dashboard with Tabs: Home / Predict / About
- Multiple Algorithms Comparison: Naive Bayes vs Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves
- Interactive Prediction: Enter messages and get predictions with confidence scores
- Downloadable Models: Save pre-trained models and TF-IDF vectorizer for deployment
- Clean, Professional UI using Streamlit

---
